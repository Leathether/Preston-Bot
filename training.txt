MOUNT ST. JOSEPH UNIVERSITY  School of Behavioral and Natural Sciences, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics NLP 105 Introduction to Linguistics for Computer Scientists Credit Hours: 3  Location: Science Building 201 . This is an in person class. The Mount is committed to in  person education this year. In the unlikely event school remains in session but we can’t meet in  the classroom, I will send out a written announcement and we all will be on Zoom synchronously  at the same times as the class would be in person.  Meeting Times: section 02--12:15 to 1:30 and section 01--1:40 to 2:55 Tuesdays and  Thursdays--see your registration for your section’ s start/end time  Faculty: Preston Frasch  For the most convenient quickest response to small questions, email me. I normally  respond within 24 hrs. You can also make an appointment to meet me on Zoom, in my  office, or the innovation hub or simply hang out after class.  Zoom: My Zoom Room is https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4979205950?pwd=hZWxLFGdcJmU2stxmWuiMi6X72hTAa.1  Email: preston.frasch@msj.edu  Office: Science 300H.  Office Phone: I am going to provide my office phone here: 513-244-4327. If needed, you  can reach me on my cell phone at 248-568-4544 (please call twice so I know it’s urgent).

If a baby hears two languages, will the baby  be confused? The course will explore language structure (syntax), language in culture and use  (pragmatics), word parts (morphology), and the sounds of human speech (phonetics and  phonology). Expect to dive into fun projects, like teaching people to speak English, creating your  own language, and finding out where you favorite words came from and why. This course 1provides necessary conceptual background for students interested in corpus linguistics and  natural language processing and is a prerequisite to Introduction to Language and Computers. Learning Outcomes and Performance Indicators  The purpose of the Core Curriculum in an under graduate education at the Mount is to provide  students with a broad range of learning experiences in order to create a mind conducive to a  lifetime of learning in a diverse society .

Even though Introduction to Linguistics for Computer Scientists is not part of the core  curriculum, there are several course objectives that deal directly with these performance  indicators. They are indicated in the course objectives. Course objectives   Successful completion of Introduction to Linguistics for Computer Scientists requires that  students: ● Articulate core concepts from the fields of phonetics and phonology as they would apply  to natural language processing, language acquisition and/or speech pathology (A1, A2,  A3, A4, B1,  ● B2) ● Discuss the major fields and theories surrounding language structure, namely syntax and  morphology (B1, B2, B5)  ● Apply psycholinguistic theories and principles to problems in areas such as language  acquisition and cross-cultural communication (A2, A3, A4, B1, B5, F2)  ● Explore how linguistic concepts are exemplified in current virtual and physical discourse  communities (D3, F2)    Learning Strategies  Content will be presented in a variety of ways including: Lecture/demonstration; small group  activities; role playing; audiovisual aids; interactive classroom discussions of assigned case  studies/readings; and independent and faculty-guided practice of assessment and techniques.  These activities will assist the learner in clarifying the concepts/theories addressed, and will  further the development of critical thinking skills. Throughout the course students will be  encouraged to reflect on the content and bring together multiple concepts in order to enhance  student learning. Students will be encouraged to be open-minded in their thinking, which allows  for personal growth and increased awareness of others. Students will be expected to complete  assigned readings and assignments prior to coming to class/lab. Students will be responsible for  any information presented in class (verbal, written, AV material, and online information), and the  required readings. Methods for Evaluating Achievement of Outcomes:  Evaluation methods are weighted as follows:  Participation (in person, or Zoom if the class meets online) 20%  Quizzes 30%  2 Assignments 2 x 10% each = 20%  Final exam (oral, website) 10%  Final Ignite Presentation 20% 3The Grading Scale Used in the NLP Program:          90% - 100%    A           80% -   89%      B           70% -   79%      C           60% -   69%     D           Below   60%     F Attendance Attendance is mandatory . Students who know they will miss/have missed a meeting should email  their instructor . Your attendance grade will be calculated based on your attendance to the  scheduled class meetings; points will be deducted from the attendance grade proportional to the  number of absences. If we have Zoom (This was a more likely possibility during the covid pandemic)  This is an in person class. The class will be in person unless the university changes their policy ,  in which case, I will make an announcement. In case needed, the following are expected class  etiquette tips for Zoom meetings.  ● If you have difficulties connecting, please let the instructor know by emailing her and  then contacting ISS Help Desk for assistance (you can reach them via Mount Roar).  ● Mute your microphone when not speaking.  ● Please run your camera. If you have a personal situation that is not conducive to the  camera being on, please email the instructor to discuss/so arrangements can be made.  ● If you have to briefly step away from the meeting to meet personal needs, please turn off  your camera, mute your microphone, and chat the instructor a brief message about when  you expect to return to class.  ● The instructor reserves the right to count a student as absent if s/he is being persistently  disruptive or non-responsive on Zoom.  ● Please remember to participate in the Zoom meeting - the Zoom meetings are intended to  be interactive. ● Any classroom recording is to be used only for the personal academic use of the  individual student, where personal academic use is restricted to the personal study use of  the individual. Mount St. Joseph University prohibits sharing, distributing, or publishing  classroom recordings in any manner . Policy on Group Work  There will be group work in this class. Aside from documented emer gencies/accommodations  (which will be accommodated appropriately), if you are non-responsive to your group/instructor  emails for a period of three days or more, the instructor may, at his/her discretion, grant the  group members permission to continue to the group assignment without your participation and  you may not earn points for that assignment. As a courtesy to all, groups are responsible for  emailing non-responsive group mates before contacting the instructor . Groups must receive  written permission from the instructor to complete assignments without the participation of all  group members. Late Policies 4Any documented accommodations will of course, be honored. Outside of cases where there is a  documented accommodation, timeliness will be taken into account when assessing the  quality/grade of the overall work. The instructor reserves that right not to accept late work.  Often times, it may not be feasible to make up late group work (i.e. lack of participation in your  group on time may result in an “zero” for that assignment). COLLEGE POLICIES Policy on Attendance  Attendance in class is mandatory . The faculty understands that at times students become ill or  have personal or family emer gencies that preclude them from attending class. Students will be  asked to sign an attendance sheet daily to document their presence in class. It is the student’ s  responsibility to make sure he/she signs the attendance record. If a student is absent he/she is  responsible for obtaining information/notes/handouts from another student.  If a student misses  more than three classes in courses that meet twice weekly , or more than two classes in courses  that meet once a week, then he/she will be asked to complete an alternative assignment. The  alternative assignment needs to be completed before a final grade can be entered for the course. Academic Honesty Policy  This course is conducted in accordance with the Academic Honesty Policy of the University .  When we use the information and language of others to enrich our reflection and research papers  we must: ● Tell the reader when we are quoting and indicate the source (person, book, article,  etc.) ● Tell the reader when we are paraphrasing and indicate the source (person, book,  article, etc.) of that information.  Quoting or paraphrasing the information and/or language of a source without naming the source  is plagiarism. Plagiarism is unacceptable in an academic institution and is subject to penalty .  Please consult the University Catalog and the Student Handbook for additional information and  policies regarding academic  honesty . http://registrar .msj.edu/under graduate-catalog/rights-policies/academic-policies/academi  c-honesty/ Physical Disability : Students with documented disabilities are encouraged to speak to course  faculty at the beginning of the semester . In compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973, the Mount St. Joseph University provides academic adjustments and auxiliary aids  for students with physical or mental impairments that substantially limit or restrict one or more  major life activities such as walking, seeing, hearing, or learning. Students with disabilities  should contact Meghann Littrell, the Director of Learning Center & Disability Services, to  present documentation and develop individualized accommodation plans (244-4524,  Meghann.Littrell@msj.edu , Learning Center , Room 156 Seton). Students who have already  registered with MSJ Disability Services are encouraged to discuss their accommodations with  their course faculty at the beginning of each semester .

Normally , aside from severe events that may involve power  outages or other adverse conditions, in*sync and online classes are not normally impacted by  weather . Delay: When a delay is announced, a start time will always be announced with it. Faculty ,  students and staff should come to campus at the announced start time. Classes that are 50-75  minutes long that are scheduled to begin before the start time are canceled and offices are closed  until the start time. Classes scheduled to begin at or after the start time will begin at their regular  time. Classes that are longer than 75 minutes, and scheduled to begin before the start time, will  meet for a shortened class period, beginning at the start time. For example, if the University  opens at 10:00 a.m.:  ● A 50-75 minute class scheduled prior to 10:00 a.m. will not be held.  ● A 120 minute class scheduled to meet from 9:00 -10:50 will begin at 10:00 and meet for  50 minutes. ● A 50 minute class scheduled to meet at 10:00 would begin meeting at 10:00 and meet for  the full time scheduled.
